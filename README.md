# K_Nearest_Neighbors
# I have my "X" and "y" prepared, so I can import "train_test_split" and get "train" and "test" set
# Then from "preprocessing" I get "StandardScaler" to make "feature scaling" 
# Prepare my "X_train" ""X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)""" and "X_test" """X_test = sc.transform(X_test)"""
